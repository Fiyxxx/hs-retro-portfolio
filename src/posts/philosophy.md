**WHY I CODE/BUILD (my philosophy)**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This past year, I started: paying for my own health insurance, finding places to live, learning from industry leaders, and of course, ORD-ing! ðŸŽ‰ 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Point being, as I step into the brushes of adulthood, it got me thinking about the **purpose** driving the way we shape our lives, the way we function, the way we work. The average person will spend **90000** hours of their lives working -- I believe that to do so aimlessly is not a life worth living. I spent a lot of time thinking about my life ahead, and so began my soul searching.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I have had the privilege of speaking with people in different industries, and during our exchanges, I learnt a lot about what drives successful people. Some are motivated by status, money, while others, the thirst for challenging themselves, and growth. Honestly, there is nothing wrong for those with materialistic pursuits, and I truly respect their work ethic to get to where they are. But it's not for me.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I love money as much as the next guy, and would obviously not mind the large six-figure TC that comes with working in big tech. But looking back to the last 21 years of my life, my happiest memories were not about gaining material things or earning money. I was happiest when I felt satisfied and fulfilled after doing something hard. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was when I built my first web app after learning React and Python for a week.

It was when I crossed the marathon finish line for the first time.

It was when my colleague told me the automation macro I coded saved them so much time.

&nbsp;

Being powered by money is not a good enough fuel for me, I want to be challenged.

I want to do something big for someone small.

I want to build ideas, pipelines, and systems that affect real, positive change in our society. This is not some grand scheme to look as noble and altruistic as possible, I don't care about how others view me. Deep down, I just want to sleep well at night, knowing that I did the best I could.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I know that goals are non-linear, and so are people. The person I am today is not the same as the child 10 years ago, nor will it be the same 10 years from now. People change. All I can to do is lead my most authentic life with purpose. I don't know what lies ahead - But I am excited.
